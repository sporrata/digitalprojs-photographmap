# Referenced Controlled Vocabularies, Schemas, and Formatting

The following information serves as a basis for ongoing metadata development. These references will continue to expand and formalize as UMKC Digital Projects works towards more interoperability across internal and external resources. Goals include more comprehensive alignment to authorities and standards adopted in the cultural heritage field.

You can see how each schema is related to an element on the [element details page](elements.md).
