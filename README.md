# UMKC Digital Projects Photograph Metadata Application Profile

## Overview

*Last updated: February 28, 2024*

This metadata application profile specifies the schema, elements, and usage guidelines for still images held by LaBudde Special Collections at the University of Missouri--Kansas City. Still images include the following image class objects as defined by UMKC Digital Special Collections program: graphics, photographs, and posters. The profile contains descriptive metadata provided post-digital conversion/reformatting for the purposes of preparing digital image files for ingest into the Digital Special Collections repository. Machine-generated technical metadata and additional technical and preservation metadata to meet minimal digital preservation standards are under development. Minimal metadata collected during intake and visual inspection are out of scope for this document.
